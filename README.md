<h3>About The Project</h3>
<p>In this Project my main aim was to learn and implement machine learning
and deep learning in real life.I started from scratch with only knowledge of
python, then i learnt Machine Learning made some programs and then move
forward to deep learning with Crowd-Density Estimation Project.
The project assigned to me was - That is counting the number of peoples in
the crowd and make a ​ Crowd Density Estimation ​ deep learning model to
predict in the real life crowd so that when a threshold of crowd will reach the
application will give alert to that specific area of crowd.</p>
